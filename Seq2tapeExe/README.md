## Seq2tape

Many pre-MIDI or low-end sequencers and drum machines use cassette tapes to store their sequence data.
This is achieved by converting the device's digital data to an analog audio signal which can be recorded onto or played back from tape.
Seq2tape is a utility for converting the audio which these devices use to data files which SeqWires can use.
It depends on per-device plugins which know how the device represents data as audio.
Currently, no plugins are included in the code base, but please watch this space :)
