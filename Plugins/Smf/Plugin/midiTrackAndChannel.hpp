    /// We pick the channel in each track which has the most events, and give it an identity
    /// which just depends on the track number. This should be pretty stable.
    /// All other channels in the track are given an identity which depends on the track number
    /// and channel. This is less stable, but OK. Problems will arise in the very rare situation
    /// where a track had a similar number of events for two channels, and on reload, the
    /// the smaller became the larger.
